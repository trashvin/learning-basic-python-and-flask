### What is a web application?

A web application is a computer program that utilizes web browsers and web technology to perform tasks over the Internet. They can come in a form of a full web application with UI or in a 'headless' form called web API's.

Flask is a Python web micro-framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy. Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in common situations the equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running. The “micro” in micro-framework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible.

The complete Flask documentation can be found [HERE](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/).

Flask depends on the Jinja template engine and the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit. The documentation for these libraries can be found at:
