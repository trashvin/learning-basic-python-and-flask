## Lesson 01 : Why Python?

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

[Guido van Rossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum) began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. The current version is now at 3.10.4.

More information can be obtained from the [official site](https://www.python.org/).

### Why use Python?

- Easy to Learn and Use : The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language.

- Mature and Supportive Python Community : There are plenty of documentation, guides and Video Tutorials for Python language are available that learner and developer of any skill level or ages can use and receive the support required to enhance their knowledge in python programming language

- Support from Renowned Corporate Sponsors : Python Programming language is heavily backed by Facebook, Amazon Web Services, and especially Google.

- Hundreds of Python Libraries and Frameworks : Due to its corporate sponsorship and big supportive community of python, python has excellent libraries that you can use to select and save your time and effort on the initial cycle of development. 

- Versatility, Efficiency, Reliability, and Speed : Python can be used in nearly any kind of environment, and one will not face any kind of performance loss issue irrespective of the platform one is working.

- Big data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing

- First-choice language : Python language is the first choice for many programmers and students due to the main reason for python being in high demand in the development market.

- The Flexibility of Python Language : Python doesnâ€™t restrict developers from developing any sort of application. This kind of freedom and flexibility by just learning one language is not available in other programming languages.

- Use of python in academics 

- Automation
